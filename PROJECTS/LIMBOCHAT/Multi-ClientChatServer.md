Perfect choice! The **multi-client chat server with authentication** is a great step up—it forces you to manage complexity while reinforcing everything you’ve learned: sockets, memory, structs, string handling, I/O, and concurrency or multiplexing.

### **Project Goal**
Build a chat server that:
1. Accepts multiple clients.
2. Requires clients to **log in or register**.
3. Broadcasts messages with the sender’s username.
4. Keeps track of who's connected.
5. Gracefully handles disconnections.

### **Key Features to Implement**

#### 1. **User Management**
- Store usernames and (hashed) passwords in a file or a simple database (e.g., plain text, JSON-style struct, or binary).
- On connection:
  - Prompt for login or register.
  - Authenticate or add new user.

#### 2. **Multi-client Handling**
- Use `select()` or `poll()` (safer than threads in C for now).
- Keep an array of active client sockets.
- When a client sends a message, broadcast it to others with the sender's username.

#### 3. **Message Format**
```text
[username]: message here
```

#### 4. **Graceful Disconnection**
- Detect when a client disconnects and free their resources.
- Broadcast to others that the user has left.

### **Tech Stack and Concepts**
- `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `recv()`, `send()`
- `select()` or `poll()` to manage multiple clients
- File I/O for storing credentials
- `struct` for holding user info
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Optional: hashing passwords (simple XOR or even a basic SHA1 implementation for now)

### **Basic Flow**
```plaintext
Client connects --> Server accepts
                --> Server sends LOGIN or REGISTER prompt
                --> Client sends credentials
                --> If authenticated, add to active users
                --> Messages sent get rebroadcasted
                --> Client disconnects -> Remove from list
```

---

### **Extra Challenges (optional)**
- Private messaging: `/msg <username> <message>`
- Command handling: `/users` to list active users
- Logging chats to a file
- Basic encryption (Caesar cipher, XOR, etc.) to explore security
