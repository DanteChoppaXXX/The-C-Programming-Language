Here are some exercises to reinforce your understanding of `struct` in C:

### **Basic Exercises**
1. **Define a `struct` for a Student**  
   - Create a `struct Student` with fields: `name`, `age`, `rollNumber`, and `marks`.  
   - Write a program to input and display student details.

2. **Array of Structures**  
   - Store details of 5 students in an array of `struct Student`.  
   - Display their information.

3. **Pass a Structure to a Function**  
   - Write a function that takes a `struct Student` as an argument and prints the details.

### **Intermediate Exercises**
4. **Structure with Nested Structures**  
   - Define a `struct Date` (day, month, year).  
   - Create an `Employee` struct with fields: `name`, `id`, `salary`, and `joiningDate` (which is a `struct Date`).  
   - Take input and display an employeeâ€™s details.

5. **Dynamic Memory Allocation for Structures**  
   - Allocate memory dynamically for an array of `struct Student` using `malloc()`.  
   - Take input and display student details.  
   - Free the allocated memory.

### **Advanced Exercises**
6. **Write and Read `struct` to/from a File**  
   - Save an array of `struct Student` to a binary file.  
   - Read the file and display the stored student details.

7. **Sorting an Array of Structures**  
   - Write a function to sort an array of `struct Student` by marks in descending order.

8. **Modify Structure Data Using Pointers**  
   - Write a function that takes a pointer to a `struct Student` and updates the marks.
