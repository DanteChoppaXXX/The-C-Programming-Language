Here are three exercises to help you understand pointers and memory management in C:  

### **Basic Level: Pointer Basics**  
**Task:**  
Write a program that declares an integer variable, assigns it a value, and then uses a pointer to:  
1. Print the address of the variable.  
2. Print the value of the variable using the pointer.  
3. Modify the value of the variable using the pointer and print the updated value.  

**Concepts Covered:** Pointer declaration, dereferencing, modifying values through pointers.

### **Intermediate Level: Dynamic Memory Allocation**  
**Task:**  
Write a program that:  
1. Asks the user for a number `n`.  
2. Dynamically allocates memory for `n` integers using `malloc()`.  
3. Fills the allocated memory with numbers from `1` to `n`.  
4. Prints the numbers stored in memory.  
5. Frees the allocated memory.  

**Concepts Covered:** `malloc()`, accessing dynamically allocated memory, `free()`.

### **Advanced Level: Pointer Arithmetic & Memory Management**  
**Task:**  
Write a function that:  
1. Takes an array of integers (dynamically allocated) and its size as input.  
2. Uses pointer arithmetic to find and return the sum of all elements in the array.  
3. The function should not use array indexing (`[]`).  
4. In `main()`, dynamically allocate an array, call the function, and print the sum.  
5. Ensure proper memory deallocation (`free()`).  

**Concepts Covered:** Pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, avoiding memory leaks.
