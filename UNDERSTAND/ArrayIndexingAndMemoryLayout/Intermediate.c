/*
Intermediate Level: Understanding Row-Major Order in 2D Arrays
Task:
Write a program that:

Declares a 3x3 matrix (2D array) and initializes it with numbers 1 to 9.
Prints the matrix in row-major order using both array notation (arr[i][j]) and pointer arithmetic (*(*(arr + i) + j)).
Prints the memory addresses of all elements in the matrix to observe how they are stored in contiguous memory.
Concepts Covered: Memory layout of 2D arrays, pointer arithmetic, row-major order storage.
