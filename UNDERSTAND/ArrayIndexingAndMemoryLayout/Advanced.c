/*
Advanced Level: Simulating 2D Arrays Using Pointers
Task:
Write a program that:

Asks the user for two integers, rows and cols, to define a dynamic 2D array.
Allocates memory for the 2D array using an array of pointers (int**).
Fills the array with values such that arr[i][j] = i * j.
Prints the array using array indexing and pointer arithmetic.
Properly deallocates memory using free().
Concepts Covered: Dynamic 2D arrays, pointer-to-pointer (int**), manual memory management.
