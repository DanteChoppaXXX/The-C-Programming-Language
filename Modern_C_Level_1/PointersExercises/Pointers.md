Here are some exercises to strengthen your understanding of pointers in C:  

### **Basic Level**  
1. **Pointer Basics**:  
   - Declare an integer variable, assign it a value, and create a pointer that holds its address.  
   - Print the variableâ€™s value using both the variable and the pointer.  

2. **Pointer Arithmetic**:  
   - Declare an array and use pointer arithmetic to access its elements.  
   - Print the elements by incrementing the pointer instead of using array indexing.  

3. **Swapping Variables**:  
   - Write a function that swaps two integers using pointers.  
   - Why canâ€™t you swap them without pointers?  

### **Intermediate Level**  
4. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:  
   - Use `malloc()` to allocate memory for an integer dynamically.  
   - Assign it a value, print it, and then free the memory.  

5. **Pointer to Pointer**:  
   - Declare an integer pointer and a pointer to that pointer.  
   - Access and modify the value of the integer using the pointer-to-pointer.  

6. **Reverse an Array Using Pointers**:  
   - Reverse an array in-place using pointers without using extra space.  

### **Advanced Level**  
7. **Function Pointers**:  
   - Write a function that takes two integers and returns their sum.  
   - Declare a function pointer and use it to call the function dynamically.  

8. **String Manipulation with Pointers**:  
   - Implement your own `strlen()` function using pointers.  
   - Implement a function to reverse a string using pointers.  

9. **Pointer and Structs**:  
   - Create a `struct` representing a `Person` (name, age).  
   - Allocate memory dynamically for a `Person` and modify its attributes using a pointer.  

10. **Pointer Security Exercise**:  
   - Simulate a basic buffer overflow by writing beyond an allocated memory block.  
   - Discuss why this is dangerous and how it can be exploited in cybersecurity.
